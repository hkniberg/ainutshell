#### **Personal Reflection:**
Oh, Daniel! You’ve certainly taken “thinking outside the box” to new heights. Your CV reads like a tech titan’s dream, but for an Artisan Baker? I hate to break it to you, but those croissants and cupcakes won’t bake themselves with your digital media wizardry. While I'm tempted to suggest you utilize Spotify’s algorithm to discover a podcast on ‘Baking 101,’ I’d rather save your precious venture capitalist brain cells for another unicorn start-up. Let's keep the bakers baking and the tech moguls... well, tech-ing.

##### Verdict: Not a match (unless we’re opening a bakery-themed tech company, in which case, let's talk!)
