# Capabilities and Limitations

![Capabilities and Limitations](.gitbook/assets/060-capabilities-limitations.png)

So what can these AI assistants actually do? And what can't they do?

Well, the short answer is: they can do a lot, but they're not magic. Let's break it down.

First, the capabilities. These AI assistants are incredibly versatile. They can:

1. Answer questions on almost any topic
2. Write content in various styles and formats
3. Translate between languages
4. Explain complex concepts in simple terms
5. Generate creative ideas
6. Help with coding and debugging
7. Analyze and summarize text

And that's just scratching the surface. The more you use them, the more you'll discover they can do.

But they also have limitations. Here are some key ones:

1. No real-time knowledge: They don't have access to current events or real-time data. Their knowledge has a cutoff date from when they were last trained.

2. No personal memory: They don't remember previous conversations unless you explicitly include that context in your prompt.

3. No true understanding: Despite how human-like they seem, they don't truly understand what they're saying. They're incredibly good at pattern matching and prediction, but they don't have consciousness or emotions.

4. Can make mistakes: They can confidently state incorrect information or make logical errors. Always fact-check important information.

5. Limited sensory input: They can process text and, in some cases, images, but they can't hear, smell, taste, or touch.

6. No ability to learn or improve themselves: They can't update their own knowledge or capabilities.

Here's a fun way to think about it: Imagine you had a super-smart alien living in your house. This alien knows a ton about Earth up until a certain date, but it can't look out the window or browse the internet. It's incredibly knowledgeable and can be extremely helpful, but it's not omniscient or infallible.

The key to getting the most out of these AI assistants is understanding both their amazing capabilities and their very real limitations. That way, you can leverage their strengths while being aware of where human oversight is still crucial.
