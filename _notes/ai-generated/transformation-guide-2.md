# AI Transformation Guide

So you want to transform your company to thrive in the age of AI? Great! Let's break it down into manageable steps. Each individual and team in your company will go through essentially three phases: Access, Experimentation, and Leverage. Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Access

First things first - everyone needs access to good AI models. Sounds simple, right? Well, not always. There might be fear, uncertainty, rules blocking access, or just plain old lack of knowledge.

Here's what you can do:

1. Figure out what it'll take for everyone to have access to a solid AI model.
2. Create a playbook and share it with everyone. Keep it simple! Include:
   - How to access the AI
   - What they're allowed to do with it
   - Any limitations (data security, privacy laws, etc.)
   - Tips on getting started

Remember, balance is key. Too little guidance, and people might be afraid to try. Too much, and they'll be overwhelmed. You want to fan the flames of innovation, not smother them with rules!

## Step 2: Experimentation

Okay, everyone's got access. Now what? It's time to plant some seeds!

Think of this phase like you're scattering seeds everywhere. You don't know which ones will grow into something amazing, but the more you plant, the better your chances.

How to promote experimentation:

1. Create communities: Slack channels, wikis, meetups, town halls. Anywhere people can share what they're learning.
2. Encourage a culture of "try stuff and it's okay to fail".
3. Make it clear that experimentation is not just permitted, but encouraged.

The good news? People naturally love to experiment. Your job is just to fan those flames and watch the wildfire spread!

## Step 3: Leverage

Alright, you've got wide-scale experimentation going. Congrats! You're already winning. But remember, the end goal isn't just learning AI - it's making your company more productive and helping it thrive in the AI age.

Here's how to boost the leverage process:

1. Re-evaluate all tasks: Look at everything you do and ask, "Can AI help with this?"
2. Use a four-step scale for each task:

   - Human-only task
   - Human task with AI assistance
   - AI task with human guidance
   - Fully autonomous AI task

3. Run workshops on business processes: Break down each process, evaluate the steps, and see where AI can fit in.

For example, we did a workshop with a Swedish construction company about handling RFPs (Requests for Proposals). We found a way to automate a lot of the initial document processing and triage. I'll dive into that more in a separate chapter, but it's a great example of finding those golden use cases where AI can make a massive difference.

As an AI champion, encourage these kinds of workshops all over the place. Get people thinking about where AI can add the most value in their day-to-day work.

## The Results

Once you've got this far, you'll start seeing productivity improvements. But here's the thing - they won't be evenly distributed. It's not like everyone will suddenly be 10% more effective. It's more like:

- This task became 1000% faster
- That process is now 100 times more efficient
- But this other thing over here? Totally unaffected

And that's okay! Keep looking for those golden use cases where AI can make an amazing difference with relatively little work. But don't discount the small wins either. Using ChatGPT to quickly summarize a document might only save a minute or two, but if everyone's doing it every day, it adds up.

Also, remember the network effects. Even a small improvement in one area can lead to big ideas and massive improvements elsewhere. It's all part of the learning process.

And here's the really cool part - the AI models themselves are improving all the time. So that task that's only 10% faster today? It might be 100% faster next year, without you doing anything extra. It's like having a virtual employee who just keeps getting smarter!

## Moving Beyond Cost-Cutting

When using AI to improve a business process, we typically go through three stages:

1. How can we do what we're already doing, but cheaper and faster?
2. How can we do it better? How can we achieve results we couldn't before?
3. What entirely new things can we do now that were impossible before?

As an AI champion, you can accelerate this process by encouraging knowledge sharing. When the marketing team shares how they reduced costs, improved value, and found a whole new approach using AI, it'll spark ideas across the entire company. Keep fanning those flames!

## Final Thoughts

This guide isn't meant to be comprehensive - we're all still figuring this out. But if you follow these steps - assign an AI champion, give everyone access, create a culture of experimentation, and start leveraging the technology across your whole organization - you'll be well-positioned to thrive in the age of AI.

And remember, at the time of writing, just about everyone is equally confused and lost in the dark. So don't worry that other companies have it all figured out. By taking these steps, you're already ahead of the game. Now go out there and transform!
