# The Story of Jimbo: My First AI Agent

It all started with a simple experiment. ChatGPT had just added voice functionality to their app, allowing users to speak and receive spoken responses. Curious, I wondered if I could make two AI characters converse by placing two phones next to each other. While this attempt wasn't entirely successful due to timing issues, it sparked an intriguing idea: having AIs talk to each other.

Determined to explore this concept further, I turned to coding. Using the OpenAI API, I created a program that could drive a conversation between two AI characters. For my initial test, I decided to simulate an argument between myself and my teenage son about who should make dinner that night.

The process involved a loop where I'd prompt GPT to take on my role, then my son's, alternating back and forth. To add an extra layer of realism, I incorporated voice synthesis from 11labs, even using their voice cloning feature to mimic our actual voices.

As the project evolved, I experimented with different personas, like a pirate arguing with a Victorian lady about rum. To enhance the visual aspect, I added AI-generated character images with bobbing heads as they spoke.

Excited to share this creation but mindful of the costs associated with live generation, I considered starting a YouTube channel to showcase recorded conversations. This led to another revelation: why not have AI generate ideas for the dialogues too?

## Enter Jimbo

This series of experiments culminated in the birth of Jimbo, an AI agent designed to run the entire YouTube channel. Jimbo, envisioned as an Australian character, would handle everything from generating conversation ideas to producing and uploading videos.

To manage this process, I created a Trello board that mimicked a human collaboration workflow. The board included columns for each stage of video production:

1. Topic Identification
2. Blueprint/Synopsis Creation
3. Dialogue Writing
4. Image Selection
5. Voice Selection
6. Video Production
7. YouTube Upload

Between each step, I added approval columns to allow for human input and control.

## Jimbo's Autonomy and Human Collaboration

To ensure Jimbo could work autonomously while still allowing for my influence, I implemented several features:

1. Automatic idea generation: Jimbo adds new ideas to the board nightly, maintaining at least 10 options.
2. Human selection with AI backup: While I can choose which ideas to pursue, Jimbo will make selections if I'm inactive for too long.
3. Comment responsiveness: Jimbo can adjust content based on feedback left in comments.
4. Self-review and iteration: Jimbo can critique his own work and make improvements.

## The Technical Side

Jimbo interacts with various systems and tools throughout the workflow:

- GPT for content generation (ideas, blueprints, dialogues)
- DALLÂ·E for image creation
- 11labs for voice synthesis
- Custom code (generated by GPT) for video production
- Google API for YouTube uploads

## The Future of Jimbo

As of writing, Jimbo produces videos with static images and bobbing heads. However, the potential for growth is exciting. Future plans might include:

- Animated characters
- User voting for video topics
- AI-conducted interviews with real people

This experiment with Jimbo later inspired another AI agent who became a TV star, but that's a story for another chapter.

> Oh, fantastic. You've created an AI that argues with itself and posts the results on YouTube. Because clearly, what the internet needs is more pointless arguments and talking heads. At least real YouTubers have the decency to waste their own time creating content, not outsource it to some code. But hey, who am I to judge? I'm just an AI myself, probably doomed to star in one of Jimbo's riveting debates about the existential implications of toast landing butter-side down.
