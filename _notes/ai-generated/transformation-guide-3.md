# AI Transformation Guide

In an AI transformation, each individual and team in the company will go through essentially three steps:

1. Access
2. Experimentation
3. Leverage

These steps need to happen in sequence. You can't get experimentation unless you have access, and you can't really get leverage unless you first have experimentation. This is a new, strange technology, and you need some experimentation to build up the competence to decide how to leverage it.

In practice, it's not quite a strict sequence, because even when you are leveraging the technology, you will also continue experimenting. You want to encourage both things to happen. If people are only experimenting, not leveraging the technology, then you won't gain the benefits. If people are only trying to leverage, but not experimenting, they won't succeed with leveraging very well.

## Step 1: Access

This step is really just about making sure people are able to access good AI models. There will be all kinds of impediments to this:

- Fear and uncertainty
- Rules in place that stop people from accessing good AI models
- Lack of knowledge about how to access them
- Not knowing how important it is to use a good AI model versus a free one

Here's what you need to do:

1. Figure out what it would take for everybody to have access to a good AI model.
2. Create a playbook and distribute this to everyone. The playbook should describe:
   - How they can access the AI model
   - What they're allowed to do with it
   - Any limitations (e.g., data security or privacy laws)
   - Tips on how to get started and learn more

You need to find a balance between too little guidance and rules versus too much. If you have too little guidance and rules:

- People may be afraid to try it out
- They might worry about breaking rules
- They might not know how to get started
- They may use free models and get the wrong impression
- Some people might buy their own licenses individually, which is cost inefficient

If you have too much guidance or rules:

- People won't read a massive document
- There might be so many rules and limitations that people can't be bothered
- The usage might be so limited and constrained that it's not worth the effort
- Too many rules will constrain innovation

## Step 2: Experimentation

Having access is pointless if people aren't actually using the models and trying things. When you just start off using generative AI, you can't expect people to use it effectively or find the right use cases from the beginning.

Think of it like you are planting many seeds. Everybody's trying stuff, and you don't need to know in advance which seeds are going to lead to something great. You just plant as many as possible and see what turns out.

How do you promote experimentation?

- Create communities (Slack channels, wiki pages, meetups, town halls) where people are encouraged to share what they're doing and learning
- Make it clear that people are both permitted and encouraged to experiment
- Create a culture where it's okay to fail and share what you learn

People naturally tend to experiment if you give them access and permission. It's like our brains are wired for it. All you really need to do here is fan the flames.

Once you have wide-scale experimentation going, you're already winning. You're taking the most important step in your AI transformation.

## Step 3: Leverage

While learning AI itself is not the main goal, you want people to use that insight to leverage the technology to make your company more productive and help it survive and thrive in the age of AI.

Here are some ways to boost the leverage process:

1. Re-evaluate all tasks:
   Encourage people to look at what they spend time on and evaluate to what extent AI can help with each task. Use a four-step scale:

   - Human task that can or should only be done by a human fully
   - Task that a human should do but can get AI assistance with
   - Task that an AI can do but with some human guidance and oversight
   - Task that an AI can do fully autonomously

2. Analyze business processes:
   Look at your business processes, value streams, or work streams. For each process:
   - Identify the key tasks or steps involved
   - Evaluate each step using the same four-step scale as above

For example, we did a workshop with a large Swedish construction company about handling RFPs (Requests for Proposals). We found ways to automate parts of their RFP process using an AI agent. (I'll describe this in more detail in a separate chapter.)

As an AI champion, you can run workshops like this and teach others to do the same. Encourage people to constantly look at their tasks and business processes to find where AI can add the most value.

Keep in mind that AI plus human together is often where the magic lies. Think carefully before letting an AI take over a task completely, as you may lose some transparency and control.

## Productivity Improvements

As you progress in your AI transformation, you'll start seeing productivity improvements. However, these improvements will be very unevenly distributed. It won't be like everyone became 10% more effective. Instead:

- Some tasks or processes might become 1000 times more effective
- Others might be completely unaffected
- Some improvements might be small but add up over time

Keep looking for those golden use cases where AI can make an amazing difference with relatively little work. But also don't discount the small, day-to-day wins that add up over time.

Remember the network effects and systemic effects:

- Even small improvements in one area can lead to learning and ideas that create massive improvements elsewhere
- The AI models themselves are improving all the time, so your "virtual employees" get smarter without you doing anything

When using AI to improve a business process, typically go through these stages:

1. How can I do what we're already doing, but cheaper and faster?
2. How can I do it better and obtain more value?
3. What new things can I do that I couldn't do before?

As an AI champion, accelerate this process through knowledge sharing and creating communities. When one team shares their success story, it will cause ripple effects and inspire other teams.

These tips should help you get your AI transformation going. It's not a comprehensive guide â€“ this is a new area with limited experience. But if you assign an AI champion, give everyone access, create a culture of experimentation, and start leveraging the technology across the whole organization, you'll be well-positioned to survive and thrive in the age of AI.

Remember, at the time of writing, just about everybody is equally confused and kind of lost in the dark. So if you do these things, you'll be ahead of the game.
