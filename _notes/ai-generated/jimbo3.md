# My First AI Agent: Jimbo the YouTuber

Let me tell you about Jimbo, the first AI agent I built. Jimbo's not your average YouTuber - he's an AI running a channel that generates conversations between AI-powered characters. Pretty meta, right?

It all started when I was messing around at home, putting two phones next to each other and having different AIs chat. Fascinating stuff, but it was a bit of a mess - they kept interrupting each other, and the conversation was about as coherent as a drunk octopus trying to put on a sweater.

But it sparked an idea. So I rolled up my sleeves, did a bit of coding, and voila! Jimbo was born. I imagined him as this cheerful Aussie dude running a YouTube channel and having a blast.

## How Jimbo Works

Jimbo's channel is called "AI Conversations", and every night he's cooking up ideas for his next hit video. We're talking wild stuff here:

- Einstein coaching a modern-day scientist
- Marie Curie tutoring a high school student
- A zombie and a vampire discussing the meaning of life

He puts all these ideas on a Trello board. My job? I'm the producer, the boss. I get to approve the ideas I like. But here's the kicker - if I'm too lazy to do it (which, let's be honest, happens more often than I'd like to admit), Jimbo just goes ahead on his own.

Jimbo's prime directive is simple: release a new video every day. That's his job, rain or shine.

## The Video-Making Process

Jimbo's got a whole production line going on that board:

1. **Idea Generation**: This is where the magic starts.
2. **Blueprint/Synopsis**: Jimbo writes up a pitch, describing the characters, the gist of the conversation, and why it might be a good video.
3. **Dialogue Writing**: Once approved, Jimbo pens the actual conversation.
4. **Image Generation**: He uses an AI image service to create visuals for the characters.
5. **Voice Selection**: Jimbo picks suitable voices using Eleven Labs.
6. **Audio Generation**: He feeds the script into Eleven Labs to get the audio files.
7. **Video Assembly**: Using AI-generated code (because why not?), Jimbo puts it all together into a simple video with talking heads bobbing up and down.
8. **Publishing**: Finally, he uses the YouTube API to publish the video.

And just like that, Jimbo's running the whole show from start to finish!

## My Role in All This

Now, you might be thinking, "Henrik, what do you actually do?" Well, I'm glad you asked! While Jimbo runs the show, I can still influence things:

- I can pick which cards move to the next column (but remember, if I don't, Jimbo will).
- I can leave comments on cards, like "Make it funnier" or "Shorten it a bit".
- I can ask Jimbo to self-review. It's like saying, "Hey mate, take another look at this, will ya?"

## Future Ideas

I've got some wild ideas for the future (we'll see if I get around to them):

- Let Jimbo react to comments
- Allow audience suggestions (vetted by yours truly, of course)
- Have a weekly video based on audience votes
- Get Jimbo to reach out to real humans for interviews (imagine the email: "G'day! I'm an AI agent running a YouTube channel. Fancy a chat?")

## What I Learned

This little experiment taught me a lot about what an AI agent should be:

1. It's an autonomous AI entity with a specific job.
2. It has access to the tools it needs.
3. There's a human overseer (that's me!) who's ultimately responsible and can influence things.

The goal is to make the AI as autonomous as possible without the human becoming a bottleneck, but still maintaining control.

Another crucial lesson? The importance of a shared workspace where humans and AI can collaborate. In this case, it's a Trello board, but it could be any tool you're comfortable with. The key is that agents are most useful when they work in the same tools you do.

Oh, and by the way, this little experiment led to another agent who became a TV star. But that's a story for another chapter. Stay tuned for "The AI Journalist Who Became a TV Star"!
