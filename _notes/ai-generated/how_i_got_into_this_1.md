# My Journey into AI

My first brush with Artificial Intelligence was during my studies at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I took a course on Artificial Neural Networks, coding small networks using Smalltalk. Even then, I was captivated by the idea of computers that could think. At the time, practical applications were limited, but the potential fascinated me.

Fast forward a few decades, and I found myself working as a Minecraft developer, building features for the game. One of my projects involved improving villager AI, particularly for children. I experimented with simple rules to create the illusion of children playing:

1. If you're being chased, run away.
2. If you see another child being chased, join the chase.
3. If you're not involved in a chase, start chasing someone.
4. Limit the number of children in a chase to three.

These simple rules created a lifelike feeling in the villages, much like how insects in nature create complex behaviors from simple individual rules.

Later, I worked on a creature called a Piglin. Just by making it look at the player, I breathed life into it. This small change created a sense of immersion and interaction that felt surprisingly real.

When ChatGPT was released, I was impressed by its ability to chat like a person, take on different roles, and generate various types of content. However, the early versions tended to hallucinate, making them less useful.

I remember a conversation with a friend while coding. He predicted that computers would soon be able to write code just like humans. I politely agreed but internally dismissed the idea as ridiculous. I couldn't imagine a computer matching the creativity and intelligence required for coding.

Then GPT-4 arrived, surpassing human capabilities in many areas, especially coding. I took time off to deep dive into this technology, using it as a coding assistant. The experience was mind-blowing – it felt like having an all-knowing coding god at my fingertips.

I learned that when GPT-4 gave me bad code, it was often due to my lack of context. As I improved at providing context and explaining what I wanted, the results became incredibly useful. Now, when I code with AI, I usually get exactly what I need, and it just works.

My first significant project with AI was building a chatbot platform called Egbert for my Minecraft server. This bot could comment on in-game events and even build up its own knowledge base of server history.

A pivotal moment came when a friend wanted to add a Telegram integration to the platform. Instead of our usual approach of studying examples and protocols, we decided to ask the AI to implement it. With minimal context – just my Discord code and the abstract interface for chat providers – we prompted the AI to implement a Telegram chat provider.

To our amazement, the AI produced a fully functional implementation that integrated perfectly with my platform. It even improved upon my existing code in some areas. This experience showed me the true potential of AI in coding.

Since then, I've always coded with AI at my side, using tools like Cursor that integrate AI directly into the development environment. On average, AI makes me 10 times more productive, sometimes even 1000 times more productive for certain tasks.

However, I've realized that human expertise is still crucial. As a developer, I'm needed to architect systems, write prompts, provide feedback, and spot potential issues. While AI is incredibly powerful, it works best in collaboration with a professional human coder.

This experience has led me to believe that developers who don't understand and utilize this technology may soon become unemployable due to their relative inefficiency. It's also opening up coding to non-professionals for simple tasks.

That's why I've made this career shift – to help others experience this level of productivity and to prepare for a future where AI and human collaboration is the norm in software development.
