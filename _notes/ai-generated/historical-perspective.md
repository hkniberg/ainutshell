# Historical perspective

Let's put this into perspective.

Humans have been around for about 300,000 years. For most of that time we've been hunter-gatherers. Then about 12,000 years ago we invented agriculture, which was a pretty big deal. It allowed us to settle down in one place and build civilizations.

Then about 250 years ago we had the industrial revolution. Machines that could do physical work. This changed everything - how we live, how we work, how we travel, everything.

Then about 70 years ago we invented computers. Machines that could do mental work. This also changed everything - how we communicate, how we learn, how we do business, everything.

And now, just in the past few years, we've invented Generative AI. Machines that can think and create. And once again, this is going to change everything.

The pace of change is accelerating. It took 12,000 years to go from agriculture to industry. Then 180 years to go from industry to computers. Then 70 years to go from computers to AI.

And AI itself is improving at an exponential rate! The capabilities of AI are doubling roughly every 6 months. That's insane! Imagine if your salary doubled every 6 months.

So what does this mean for the future?

Well, nobody really knows. But it's pretty clear that the world is going to change dramatically, and fast. Some jobs will disappear, new jobs will appear. The way we work, learn, and live is going to change.

The big question is - will we use this technology wisely? Will we use it to solve big problems like climate change and disease? Or will we use it to create more problems?

That's up to us. And that's why it's so important to understand this technology.
