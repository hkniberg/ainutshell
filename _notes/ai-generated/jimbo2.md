# The Birth of Jimbo: My First AI Agent

So, let me tell you about Jimbo, my first AI agent. It all started with a fun little experiment, as most things do for me.

ChatGPT had just added voice functionality to their app, allowing you to speak to it and have it speak back. I got curious: could we make two AI characters talk to each other by putting two phones next to each other? 

Spoiler alert: it didn't work so well. The app wasn't great at knowing when to respond, so they kept interrupting each other and getting confused. But it got me thinking about AIs talking to each other, and I was intrigued enough to write some code.

## The Code Behind the Conversation

I whipped up a program that interacts with OpenAI's API, driving a conversation between two characters. For fun, I decided to create AI personas of me and my teenage son arguing about who should make dinner tonight. 

The code would prompt GPT: "Take on the role of Henrik, arguing why Peter should make dinner." Then it would take that response and say, "Now be Peter, and respond to this." And so on, in a loop.

To make it more interesting, I used a voice synthesis service from 11labs. I even found a voice cloning feature, recording a minute of me and Peter talking, then using that to generate our voices saying any text. 

The result? A silly little program where AI versions of me and Peter would argue forever. It was pretty hilarious.

## From Experiment to YouTube Channel

I tried different personas - like a pirate arguing with a Victorian old lady about the merits of drinking rum. I added some AI-generated visuals, showing their heads bobbing up and down as they spoke. It was fun, but generating these conversations live was getting expensive.

So, I thought, why not make a YouTube channel? I'd record some of these conversations and upload them. But then I needed ideas for dialogues and characters. 

Being the AI enthusiast I am, I figured, why not let AI generate the ideas too? After some prompt engineering, I got GPT-4 to come up with really creative dialogue ideas.

And then it hit me: what if we take this all the way? What if I make an AI agent that runs this whole channel?

## Enter Jimbo

That's how Jimbo was born. I envisioned him as an Australian guy running this YouTube channel, making up fun conversations. But I wanted some level of control and insight, so I set up a Trello board to track the workflow.

The process goes something like this:
1. Identify a topic
2. Write a blueprint (or synopsis)
3. Write the dialogue
4. Select suitable images
5. Choose appropriate voices
6. Make the actual video
7. Upload to YouTube

I designed it so Jimbo could work autonomously, but with human input. Every night, he adds new ideas to the board. I can select which ones to pursue, but if I don't, Jimbo will choose himself after a while. He's not going to wait around!

## Jimbo's Toolbox

Jimbo interacts with different systems using various tools:
- GPT for generating content, blueprints, and dialogue
- DALLÂ·E for creating images
- 11labs for voice synthesis
- Custom code (written by GPT) for video production
- Google API for YouTube publishing

He can even respond to comments, self-review, and iterate on his own work. Talk about self-improvement!

## The Future of Jimbo

By the time you read this, who knows what Jimbo might be capable of? Maybe animated characters instead of just bobbing heads? Taking suggestions via comments? Interviewing real humans podcast-style? The possibilities are endless.

And here's a teaser: this little experiment later gave birth to another AI agent who became a TV star. But that's a story for another chapter...

So there you have it - the tale of Jimbo, my first AI agent. It's amazing what you can create with a bit of curiosity, some code, and a whole lot of AI. Who knows what kind of digital creatures we'll be cooking up next?
