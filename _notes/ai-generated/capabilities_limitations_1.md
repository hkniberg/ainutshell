# Capabilities and Limitations

![Capabilities and Limitations](.gitbook/assets/060-capabilities-limitations.png)

So what can these AI assistants actually do? And what can't they do?

Well, the short answer is: they can do a lot, but they're not magic. Let's break it down.

First, the good stuff. AI assistants are incredibly versatile. They can:

1. Write and edit text in any style or format
2. Translate between languages
3. Summarize long documents
4. Answer questions and explain complex topics
5. Solve math problems and write code
6. Generate creative ideas for stories, marketing campaigns, or product designs
7. Analyze data and spot patterns

And that's just scratching the surface. The more you use them, the more surprising capabilities you'll discover.

But they also have important limitations:

1. No real-time knowledge: They don't have access to current events or real-time data. Their knowledge has a cut-off date from when they were last trained.

2. No memory: They don't remember previous conversations unless you explicitly include that context in your prompt.

3. No true understanding: They don't actually "understand" things in the way humans do. They're incredibly good at pattern matching and text prediction, but they don't have consciousness or emotions.

4. Hallucinations: Sometimes they can confidently state things that are completely false. Always fact-check important information.

5. Bias: They can reflect biases present in their training data.

6. No direct internet access: They can't browse the web, send emails, or interact with other systems unless specifically set up to do so.

7. Limited context: There's a limit to how much text they can process at once.

Understanding these capabilities and limitations is crucial for using AI assistants effectively. It's like having a super-smart intern who knows a lot but can't leave the office or look things up online. You need to know when to rely on them and when to double-check their work.

Remember, AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment. Used wisely, it can dramatically boost your productivity and creativity. But it's up to you to guide it, verify its output, and make the final decisions.
