# Jimbo: My First AI Agent

Let me tell you about Jimbo. He's an AI agent, and he happens to be the first one I built. Jimbo's a YouTuber, running a channel that generates conversations between AI-powered characters.

The backstory? Well, I was messing around at home, putting two phones next to each other and having different AIs chat. Fascinating stuff, but it didn't work great - they kept interrupting each other, making it hard to follow. But it was inspiring enough that I started coding, and voila! Jimbo was born.

I modeled Jimbo after some cheerful, cool Australian guy running a channel and having a bit of fun. His YouTube channel is called "AI Conversations", and every night, he comes up with ideas for what these characters could talk about. For example:

- Einstein coaching someone
- Marie Curie tutoring a high school student
- A zombie and a vampire discussing the meaning of life

Sometimes historical figures, sometimes made-up characters. He puts these ideas on a board, and I go in and approve the ones I like. But here's the kicker - if I'm too lazy to do that, he'll just do it on his own. 

My job? I'm kind of the producer, or the boss. Jimbo's job is to come up with all the ideas, do all the creative stuff, make the videos. The deal is, I get to call the shots, but if I don't, he'll just call them himself. Jimbo's main goal, his number one priority, is to release a new video every day. That's his job.

The videos go through a multi-step process, all reflected on the board:

1. Idea generation
2. Blueprint/synopsis creation
3. Dialogue writing
4. Image generation
5. Voice selection
6. Audio generation
7. Video compilation
8. Publishing to YouTube

At each step, I can approve or make comments, but if I don't, Jimbo moves forward on his own. He uses various AI services for different tasks - image generation, voice synthesis (Eleven Labs), and even the code to compile the video was AI-generated!

The final product? A simple video with two talking heads bobbing up and down as they chat, with a background picture. Just a few minutes of fun conversation between two characters.

This was a bit of an experiment. I wanted to see how far I could go with letting an AI agent run the whole process from end to end.

## What I Learned

This little project taught me a lot about what an AI agent is or should be:

1. It's an autonomous AI entity with a specific job and responsibility.
2. It has access to the tools it needs to do the job.
3. There's a human overseer who's ultimately responsible for the output.
4. It's about finding a balance - I want the AI to be as autonomous as possible without the human becoming a bottleneck, but the human should still have control.

Another key takeaway was the importance of a shared workspace where humans and AI can collaborate. In this case, I used a Trello board, but it could be any tool - a spreadsheet, Google Doc, or Miro board. The point is, agents are most useful when they work in the same tools you use, making the work truly collaborative.

## Future Ideas

I've got some plans for Jimbo's future, if I get around to it:

- Letting Jimbo react to audience comments
- Allowing viewers to suggest ideas (with human vetting, of course)
- Maybe once a week, creating a video based on audience votes
- My craziest idea? Having Jimbo reach out to famous or interesting people for interviews. Imagine an AI agent producing videos of discussions with humans, like a podcast!

This experiment with Jimbo later led to another agent who became a TV star. But that's a story for another chapter - "The AI Journalist Who Became a TV Star". Stay tuned!
