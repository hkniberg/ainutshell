What's interesting too is that traditionally, to do these kind of things, to create a model that acts in a certain way, you'd have to train a custom model, gather a lot of data, and have a team of professional data scientists to get it to work. There'd be a lot of cost involved in the hardware and software. But now, with models like this, you just give it a few examples, and then boom, you've pretty much done the equivalent of training a custom model for something.

So that's one thing to keep an eye on. What kind of IT projects do you have that you're working on that are expensive and time-consuming that can be done much simpler now with this technology? Make sure everyone learns how to use generative AI because you'll find that some things that used to be really hard and expensive and time-consuming are actually quite simple now. And that's kind of part of my consulting practices, to help companies identify these areas.
