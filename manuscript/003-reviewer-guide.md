# Reviewer guide

This is a draft book based on my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw).

Thanks for helping taking the time to read and review it!
The book currently lives on LeanPub, but will become available on Amazon and other stores later - both as ebook and printed book.

My goal for the book is that it should go viral and spread through word of mouth, because people find it interesting and useful (like the video). I want to keep it somewhat short (especially the first part of the book), fast-paced, and with a touch of humor to keep the reader engaged.

## How to give feedback

Any feedback is welcome! You can email me at h@kniberg.com, or comment directly on LeanPub.

Some questions on my mind:

- What is your overall impression of the book? Would you recommend it to others? If not, what would need to change for you to recommend it?
- How do you like the high level approach & structure of the book, with the two sections?
- Part 2 is almost like a collection of independent essays. What do you think of these? Any favorites? Any ones that I should remove?
- If I should add or remove anything from the book, what would you suggest?
- Any other feedback or thoughts on the book?

Caveats (= stuff I don't need feedback on):

- I haven't done much spell-checking or grammar-checking, so never mind that.
- I haven't fiddled with image sizes, so I know that some are way too big.
