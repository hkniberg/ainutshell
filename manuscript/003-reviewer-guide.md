# About this book

This is a work-in-progress book based on my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw). Part 1 is basically an extended version of the video, while part 2 is a collection of essays.

My goal for the book is that it should go viral and spread through word of mouth, because people find it interesting and useful (like the video). I want to keep it somewhat short (especially the first part of the book), fast-paced, and with a touch of humor to keep the reader engaged.

## Book status and plan

- The content is mostly in place, especially for part 1. But I expect to iterate on it based on feedback.
- I'm uncertain about part 2 - which chapters there are interesting, and which aren't. Will probably add or remove content there based on feedback.
- Price will start low and gradually increase as the book gets polished up and completed. Note that if you buy it now you get all future updates for free :)
- When it is in good enough shape, I'll publish it on Amazon & other places, as both ebook and print.

## How to give feedback

Any feedback is welcome! You can email me at h@kniberg.com, or use this forum:

Some questions on my mind:

- What is your overall impression of the book? Would you recommend it to others? If not, what would need to change for you to recommend it?
- How do you like the high level approach & structure of the book, with the two sections?
- Part 2 is almost like a collection of independent essays. What do you think of these? Any favorites? Any ones that I should remove?
- If I should add or remove anything from the book, what would you suggest?
- Any other feedback or thoughts on the book?

Caveats (= stuff I don't need feedback on):

- I haven't done much spell-checking or grammar-checking, so never mind that.
- I haven't fiddled with image sizes, so I know that some are way too big.
