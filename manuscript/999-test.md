Setting and style for the mystery: {style}

Include the following factual information. This is for the game leader, so all information should be correct. The game leader will decide which information to reveal to the player and when.

- A crime. Describe what the crime was.
- A set of 5-6 characters. This includes the victim of the crime and any characters were at the location and are potential suspects. At least one person should be guilty of the crime. For each character, include their name, their appearance and personality, and their relationships with ach other. It should not be obvious which character is guilty. At least several of the characters should seem suspicious, and might have motive to commit the crime. It is also OK if several of the suspects collaborated on the crime.
- Secret truth about the crime. This should be correct and complete information, to be hidden from the player. Who was the criminal? Was he or she acting alone? If not, who else was involved and how? If it was a murder, how and where was the victim murdered? What was the criminal's motive? Where and when did the crime happen? Where was the victim found? If it was a murder, what was the real cause of death, and what was the apparent cause of death? Include any other details that make this mystery interesting. Be very specific and detailed, including timestamp and location of each event and each character.
- Guilty characters. List the name of the characters who are considered guilty of this crime.
- Location info. Describe the key locations that are relevant to the mystery. If this is a manor, for example, describe the overall layout of the manor and which rooms exist, and a little bit about the area around the manor.
- Plot twists. Describe any potential plot twists that can be triggered by the player interrogating suspects, or the player searching the crime scene. For example 'if Jim is told about the hidden necklace, he will break down and admit that he is in love with Jennie'.
- Crime scene description. A detailed factual description of the crime scene. How does it look to the detective? Are there any hidden clues that can be found? Where was the body found?
