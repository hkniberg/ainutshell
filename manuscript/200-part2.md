# Part 2

Welcome to part 2! This part is like a buffet, you can choose to eat as much or as little as you want, and in whatever order you like.

We'll dive into some more advanced topics, concrete tips and examples, and some silliness. Some may be relevant to you, some not, so I suggest you browse the chapter names and pick and choose what you want to read.
