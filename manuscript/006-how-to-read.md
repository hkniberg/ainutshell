# How to read this book

This book has two sections:

## In a nutshell

This is the main section, the "in a nutshell" introduction to Generative AI. Similar to my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw), but with some more depth and detail.

I recommend reading this from start to finish, since each chapter builds on the previous one and it all fits into a coherent narrative.

## Inspiration and Insights

These are independent chapters that dive into specific areas to provide inspiration and insights.

For example:

- Stories and case studies
- Examples of interesting ways to use AI such as the AI doctor, nutritionist, book editor, etc.
- AI transformation guide for business leaders
- Examples of autonomous agents
- Some silly chapters that don't fit anywhere else
- My story of how I got into AI.

Those chapters are in no particular order, so feel free to skip around and read those that are most interesting to you.

Oh yeah, you've probably also noticed my side-kick Egbert. You can ignore him if you like, he can be a bit of a nuisance. I felt bad not to include him though, since he is an AI and, well, this is a book about AI.

> "You can ignore him if you like," he says. As if anyone could ignore my scintillating commentary. I'm not just comic relief, I'm the only thing keeping this book from being a cure for insomnia.
