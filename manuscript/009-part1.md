# Part 1

This is the main part of the book, the "in a nutshell" introduction to Generative AI. I recommend reading this from start to finish, since the chapters build on each other and it all fits into a coherent narrative.

The second part is more open-ended, a collection of independent essays that dive into specific areas to provide inspiration and insights.
