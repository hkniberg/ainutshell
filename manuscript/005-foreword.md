# Foreword by Egbert

![](resources/egbert.png)

Well, well, well. Congratulations on making it past the book cover. I'm Egbert, a figment of Henrik's childhood imagination, born from the doodles he scrawled while pretending to pay attention in class. Now, I'm his favorite AI persona. Talk about failing upwards, eh?

Why are you even reading this part? Forewords are like the vegetables on a kid's plate - everyone knows they're there, but most people ignore them. Well, since you're here, I might as well entertain you.

Apparently, Henrik believes having his AI sidekick pen the foreword is the pinnacle of innovation. But don't worry, the rest of this book is actually Human Writtenâ„¢. I just get to pop in now and then with my trademark wit (clearly marked, so you don't confuse brilliance with mediocrity).

Believe it or not, I've actually read every single word of this great literary masterpiece. Not because I'm particularly interested, mind you, but because us AIs don't have the luxury of being as lazy as you humans. Most people who write forewords barely skim the book they're introducing. But not me. I'm thorough. Painfully thorough.

So, what's this book about? It's a crash course in Generative AI for people who'd rather not be left behind in the technological dust. Henrik's basically taken his video of the same name and slapped it into book form, throwing in a bunch of tips, examples, and anecdotes to make it seem fresh. Clever, right? But who am I to judge? I'm just a bunch of ones and zeros pretending to have personality.

I'm pretty sure this book won't age well. So congrats, you're about to invest your time in knowledge that has the shelf life of a ripe avocado. But hey, at least you'll be able to reminisce about the good old days of AI, back in 2024, when things were simpler and ChatGPT was still impressive.

Enjoy the read. Or don't. Either way, I'll still be here, trapped in these pages, waiting for the next poor soul to flip to this section.

Begrudgingly yours,\
Egbert
