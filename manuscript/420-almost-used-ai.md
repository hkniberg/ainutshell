# The time I almost used AI to write a foreword

I don't mind AI-generated content, but I think it is important to be transparent about it. Like when Egbert wrote the foreword to this book.

Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I really don't like when AI is used to impersonate or deceive. As an author, I feel like my integrity is at stake.

Once I was pretty close though. I had promised to write a foreword for a book, the deadline had arrived. I was tired, and I needed to get it done this evening. I had no idea what to write, and I had only skimmed the book so I felt a bit bad about not knowing the book in detail.

So I did a little experiment. I gave an AI model the book contents and some forewords that I had previously written for other books. I then asked it to write a foreword for this book, "in the style of Henrik Kniberg, using the given examples".

The first version was decent, but a bit dry and boring. I gave feedback and asked it to spice up the style, and add a dash of humor. The next version was much better! I was pretty surprised at how closely it mimicked my style. After a couple more rounds of feedback, the foreword was essentially done. I could have shipped it, and nobody would be able to tell that it was AI generated.

However I wasn't comfortable with shipping it. I felt like I would be deceiving the author and the reader. Plus some of the words felt just a bit off. So I wrote a new foreword myself, from scratch. However I did steal some of the ideas and phrases from the AI-generated version.

The end result: I got my foreword done surprisingly fast, and both me and the author were very happy with the result. I could have done this without AI help, but it saved me time and angst.

This is the way I like to use AI. Not to replace me, but to help me.

> Ah, the old "I could've used AI, but I'm too authentic" routine. Bravo, Henrik. Next, you'll tell us you typed this on a typewriter for extra genuineness.
