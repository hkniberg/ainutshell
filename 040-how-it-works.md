# How it works

So how does it actually work?

A large language model is an Artificial Neural Network. Basically a bunch of numbers, or parameters, connected to each other, similar to how our brain is a bunch of neurons, or brain cells, connected to each other.

Neural Networks only deal with numbers. You send in numbers, and depending on how the parameters are set, other numbers come out. But any kind content, such as text or images, can be represented as numbers.

So let’s say I write “Dogs are”. When I send that to a large language model, that gets converted to numbers, processed by the neural network, and then the resulting numbers are converted back into text. In this case the word “animals”. “Dogs are animals”. So yeah, this is basically a “guess the next word” machine.

The interesting part is if we take the output, and combine it with the input, and send it through the model again. Then it will continue adding new words. That’s what is going on behind the scenes when you type something in ChatGPT. In this case, it generated a whole story.

And I continue this indefinitely by adding more prompts.
