# Wrapup

OK let’s wrap it up. Here are the key things I hope you will remember.

- Generative AI a super useful tool that can help both you, your team, and your company in a big way.
- The better you understand it, the more likely it is to be an opportunity rather than a threat.
- Generative AI is more powerful than you think. The biggest limitation is not the tech, it is your imagination (“what can I do”), and your prompt engineering skills (“How do I do it”).
- Prompt Engineering/Design is a crucial skill. Like all new skills, just accept that you will suck at it at first, but you will improve over time with deliberate practice.

So my best tip is, experiment. Make this part of your day-to-day life, and the learning happens automatically.
