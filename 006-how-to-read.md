# How to read this book

This book has two sections:

## Main part

This is the main "in a nutshell" introduction to Generative AI. Similar to my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw), but with some more depth and detail.

I recommend reading this from start to finish, since each chapter builds on the previous ones and it all fits into a coherent story.

## Extra material

These are independent chapters that dive into specific areas, such as:

- Stories and case studies
- Examples of interesting ways to use AI
- How to use AI to transform your work or business
- Examples of autonomous agents
- Some silly chapters that don't fit anywhere else
- How I got into this, and how the book was written

Here it makes sense to skip around and read only those chapters that interest you.
The chapters aren't really in any particular order.

Oh yeah, you've probably also noticed my side-kick Egbert. You can ignore him if you like, he can be a bit of a nuisance. I felt bad not to include him though, since he is an AI and, well, this is a book about AI.

> "You can ignore him if you like," he says. As if anyone could ignore my scintillating commentary. I'm not just comic relief, I'm the only thing keeping this book from being a cure for insomnia.
