# How to read this book

This book has two sections:

## Main part

This is the main "in a nutshell" introduction to Generative AI. Similar to my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw), but with some more depth and detail.

I recommend reading this from start to finish, since each chapter builds on the previous ones and it all fits into a coherent story.

## Extra material

These are independent chapters that dive into specific areas, such as:

- Stories and case studies
- Examples of interesting ways to use AI
- How to use AI to transform your work or business
- Examples of autonomous agents
- Some silly chapters that don't fit anywhere else

Here it makes sense to skip around and read only those chapters that interest you.
