# Autonomous agents with tools

I think the next frontier for Generative AI is autonomous agents with tools.

These are AI-powered software entities that run on their own, rather than sitting and waiting for you to prompt them all the time.

So you go down to Einstein in the basement and do what a good leader would do for a team. You give him a high level mission and the tools need to accomplish it, and then open the door and let him out to run his own show, without micromanagement. The tools could be things like access to the Internet, access to money, ability to send and receive messages, order pizza, or whatever.

For this, prompt engineering becomes even more important. Because your autonomous tool-wielding agent can do a lot of good or a lot of harm depending on how you craft that mission statement.
