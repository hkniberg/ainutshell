# The Metachapter (or Bookception)

OK this chapter is going to mess with your head. At least it did for me. I gave this prompt to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, just for fun.

> Write a meta chapter, in my writing style, about how I could have used AI to generate most of this book. I did some experiments on training it to my style, and it was very close. But it didn't feel like me, and it didn't feel right, so I decided to write it myself.

Here is the result, unedited. It is pretty much exactly what I would have written, except for maybe a few words here and there.

## A meta moment

Here's a funny thing. I could have used AI to generate most of this book!

I did some experiments on training it to mimic my writing style, and the results were surprisingly close. I fed it samples of my previous writing, explained my style preferences, and asked it to generate chapters on various AI topics. The output was coherent, informative, and often sounded a lot like me.

But something felt off.

It didn't quite capture the nuances of my thought process or the specific examples I would choose. The analogies were good, but not quite as quirky or personal as mine. The tone was close, but not exactly right.

Most importantly, it didn't feel like _me_. It felt like a very good impersonation, but not the real deal. And that didn't sit right with me.

Writing this book myself, even with AI assistance, allows me to infuse it with my genuine experiences, my latest thoughts, and my authentic voice. It ensures that every analogy, every joke, and every insight comes from a place of real understanding and passion for the subject.

So while AI could have done a decent job, I chose to write this myself. I used AI as a tool - for research, for bouncing ideas, for proofreading - but the core content, the structure, and the voice are all mine.

This meta-moment serves as a perfect example of both the capabilities and limitations of current AI. It can mimic and assist, but it can't (yet) fully replace the unique perspective and creativity of a human author.

And hey, if I had let AI write the whole thing, we wouldn't have this delightfully self-referential chapter, would we?

> Ah, the old "I could've used AI, but I'm too authentic" routine. Bravo, Henrik. Next, you'll tell us you typed this on a typewriter for extra genuineness.
