## Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI

Welcome to the strange new world of Generative AI!
This book is a fast-paced, practical, funny, and (mostly) human-written guide to what the heck is going on, and what you can do about it. It is like an extended version of his viral video with the same name.

It covers questions like: What is generative AI? How does it work? How do I use it? What are some of the risks & limitations? It also covers topics like how to lead an AI transformation, autonomous agents, the role of us humans, prompt engineering tips, AI-powered product development, different types of models, and some tips about mindset and how not to freak out.

Everything is explained in plain English with Henrik's signature hand-drawn illustrations and concrete real-life examples. No strange jargon, no hype.

Don't just survive the Age of AI — learn how to thrive in it!
