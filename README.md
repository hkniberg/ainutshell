## Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI

This is work-in-progress book based on my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw).

If you see this README then I've probably sent you this as manuscript, or asked you to read & review the book.
The book lives here in gitbook for now while I'm writing and finalizing it, then we'll see I need to move it somewhere.

My plan is to publish this as an ebook as well as a printed book. Not sure yet if I will use a normal publisher or self-publish.

Any feedback is welcome! Well, I haven't done much spell-checking or grammar-checking, so that kind of feedback is probably not useful. But anything else is welcome!
