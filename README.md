## Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI

This is draft book based on my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw).

If you see this README then I've probably sent you this as manuscript, or asked you to read & review the book. The book lives here in gitbook for now while I'm writing and finalizing it, then we'll see if I need to move it somewhere.

My plan is to publish this as an ebook as well as a printed book. Not sure yet if I will use a normal publisher or self-publish.

My goal for the book is that it should go viral and spread through word of mouth, because people find it interesting and useful (like the video).

Any feedback is welcome!

Some questions on my mind:

- What is your overall impression of the book? Would you recommend it to others? If not, what would need to change for you to recommend it?
- How do you like the high level approach & structure of the book, with the two sections?
- Part 2 is almost like a collection of independent essays. What do you think of these? Any favorites? Any ones that I should remove?
- If I should add or remove anything from the book, what would you suggest?
- Any other feedback or thoughts on the book?

Caveats (= stuff I don't need feedback on):

- I haven't done much spell-checking or grammar-checking, so never mind that.
- I haven't fiddled with image sizes, so I know that some are way too big.
- Gitbook doesn't allow for much formatting, so I've kept it simple for now.
