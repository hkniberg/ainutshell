## Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI

This is work-in-progress, a book version of my video [Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw).

It will have four sections:

- Main part = basically the video transcript, but with some additional content
- Use cases = examples of how AI is used in the real world
- Transformation guide = how to use AI to transform your work or business
- Extra material = various related content and ramblings

You can read it page-by-page, or jump around using the table of contents to the right.

My plan is to publish this as an ebook as well as a printed book.
