# Model types

Note that there are different types of Generative AI models that generate different types of content.

Text to Text models, like GPT 4, take text as input and generate text as output. The text can be natural language, but it can also be structured information like code, json or html. I use this a lot to generate code when programming, it saves an incredible amount of time, and I also learn a lot from the code it generates.

Text to Image models will generate images. Describe what you want and an image gets generated for you. You can even pick a style.

Image to Image models. can do things like transforming or combining images.

Image to Text models describe the contents of a given image.

Speech to text models create voice transcriptions, which is useful for things like meeting notes.

Text to Audio models can generate music or sounds. For example here is sound generated from the prompt “People talking in a busy restaurant”. OK guys, enough, thank you.

There are even Text to Video models that generate videos from a prompt. Sooner or later we’ll have infinite movie series that autogenerate the next episode tailored to your tastes, as you are watching. Kind of scary if you think about it.
