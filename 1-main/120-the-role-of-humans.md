# The role of humans

So one important question is:
Is <human role X> needed in the Age of AI? For example are Doctors needed? Developers? Lawyers? CEOs? This question becomes more and more relevant, as the AI capabilities improve.

Well, some jobs will disappear for sure. But for most roles, I think we humans are still needed. Someone with domain knowledge needs to decide what to ask the AI, how to formulate the prompt, what context needs to be provided, and how to evaluate the result.

AI models aren’t perfect. They can be absolutely brilliant, but sometimes also terribly stupid. They can sometimes hallucinate and provide bogus information in a very convincing way. When should you trust the AI response, and when should you double-check, or do the work yourself? What about legal compliance and data security? What information can we send to an AI model, and where it that data stored? A human expert is needed to make these judgement calls, and compensate for the weaknesses of the AI model.

I recommend thinking of AI as your colleague. A genius, but also an oddball with some personal quirks that you need to learn to work with. You need to recognize when your genius colleague is drunk.

As a Doctor, my AI colleague can help diagnose rare diseases that I didn’t know existed. As a Lawyer, my AI colleague could do legal research and review contracts, allowing me to spend more time with my client. As teacher, my AI colleague could grade tests, help generate course content, provide individual support to students, etc.

And if you’re not sure how it can help, just ask it.“I work as X, how can you help me?”.

Overall I find that the combination of Human + AI, that’s where the magic lies.
