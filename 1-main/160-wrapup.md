# Wrapup

Congrats, you've gotten through the main "In a nutshell" section of this book!
You now have an overview of what Generative AI is, and you've gotten a bunch of concrete tips for how to survive and thrive in the Age of AI!

Here are the key things I hope you will remember.

- Generative AI a super useful tool that can help both you, your team, and your company in a big way.
- The better you understand it, the more likely it is to be an opportunity rather than a threat.
- Generative AI is more powerful than you think. The biggest limitation is not the tech, it is your imagination (“what can I do”), and your prompt engineering skills (“How do I do it”).
- Prompt Engineering/Design is a crucial skill. Like all new skills, just accept that you will suck at it at first, but you will improve over time with deliberate practice.

So my best tip is, experiment. Make this part of your day-to-day life, and the learning happens automatically.

In the rest of this book we'll dive into some more advanced topics, concrete tips and examples, and some silliness. Some may be relevant to you, some not, so I suggest you browse the chapter names and pick and choose what you want to read.
