# Prompt engineering

In order to use Generative AI effectively, you need to get good at Prompt Engineering. I think Prompt Design would be a better term, but Prompt Engineering seems to have stuck so we'll go with that.

Prompt Engineering is the art of crafting effective prompts that produce useful results from an AI model. This skill is important whether you are using or building an AI product.

# Example - from bad to good prompt

Here’s an example. Let’s say I want help planning a workshop.

> **Prompt 1**  
> Give me an agenda for a workshop

This prompt is unlikely to give useful results. No matter how smart the AI is, if it doesn’t know the context of my workshop, it can only give vague, high level recommendations.

Let's improve it.

> **Prompt 2**  
> Give me an agenda for a workshop.  
> I'm meeting a leadership team at an aurospace consulting firm. The goal of the workshop is figure out how they can use AI. They are new to this. We have 8 people for 4 hours.

This second prompt is better. Now I provided a context. This is normally done iteratively. Write a prompt, look at the result, add a followup prompt to provide more information, or edit the original prompt. Rinse and repeat until you get a good result. More on that later in this chapter.

Here's another useful prompt engineering technique:

> **Prompt 3**
> Give me an agenda for a workshop.  
> Feel free to ask me any clarifying questions first.

Instead of me providing a bunch of context upfront, I'm asking it to interview me to get the context it needs, and then propose a workshop agenda after. So the AI is iterating over the conversation instead of me.

I often combine these techniques. I provide a bit of context, and then tell it to ask me if it needs any more info.

## The biggest limitation is you

The biggest limitation is not the AI model, but the quality of your prompts, and hence your prompt engineering skill. I keep seeing this. Whenever I get a bad or mediocre result from an AI, it almost always turns out to be because of a badly phrased prompt, or lack of context. When I fix the prompt, the results improve dramatically.

I've experienced situations where I'm sitting next a colleague, both of us are working on similar things and using AI assistance, and he keeps getting mediocre results while I keep getting really good results. At first glance you'd think that I was using a better model, but in fact I was just more experienced with prompt engineering and knew how to phrase a good prompt and provide just the right context.

# How do I learn Prompt Engineering?

There are plenty of courses, books, videos, and articles to help you learn this, but the most important thing is to practice, and learn by doing.

A nice side effect is that you will become better at communicating in general, since Prompt Engineering is really all about clarity and effective communication.
