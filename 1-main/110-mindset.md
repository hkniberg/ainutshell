# Mindset

I’ve noticed that People and companies tend to fall into different Mindset categories when it comes to AI.

On one side we have Denial – the belief that AI cannot do my job, or we don’t have time to look into this technology. This a dangerous place to be. A common saying is “AI might not take your job, but people using AI will” - this is true for both individuals and companies.

On the other side of the scale we have Panic and Despair, the belief that AI is going to take my job no matter what, AI is going make my company go bankrupt.

Neither of these mindsets are helpful. I propose a middle ground, a balanced, positive mindset. “AI is going to make me, my team, my company, insanely productive!”.

Personally, with this mindset, I feel like I’ve gained superpowers. I can go from idea to result in so much shorter time. I can focus more on what I want to achieve and less on the grunt work of building things. And I’m learning a lot faster too, like having an awesome mentor with me at all times.

This mindset not only feels good, but it also equips you for the future, makes you less likely to lose your job or company, and more likely to thrive in the age of AI, despite all the uncertainty.
