# Multimodal models

One trend is multi-modal AI products. Meaning they combine different models into one product, so you can work with text, images, audio, etc, without switching tools.

The ChatGPT is a good example of a multimodal AI product. You can speak to it, and it can speak back. You can upload images, camera photos, and documents, and it can generate images. I used ChatGPT for all the examples below. Although by the time you read this, there are probably other apps that can do this too.

## Example: Is my bacon done?

Here's a silly example of multimodality, using the ChatGPT mobile app.

I took a picture of my frying pan while cooking bacon, and asked if it was done.
The input was an image (take from the phone), and my recorded voice asking if the bacon is done. The model converted my voice to text, interpreted the image to text, and then used that to generate a text response.

OK not super useful in this particular case, more a fun little experiment. But it shows the potential.

## Example: Where can I hide stuff?

Just for fun, I took a photo of this room and asked where I could hide stuff. The response:

> If you're looking to hide something valuable in this room, you have several options. Here are a few suggestions:
>
> 1. **Behind the map**: You could tape something flat, like documents or cash, behind the large map on the wall.
>
> 2. **Inside the guitar**: If the guitar has a case, you could hide something inside it. If not, small items could potentially be placed through the sound hole, although this is not advisable if it could damage the instrument.
>
> 3. **Under the couch cushions**: A common hiding spot, but effective for small and flat items.
>
> 4. **Behind or under the wood stove**: If there is any removable panel or space, although this is risky due to the heat when in use.
>
> 5. **In the lamp**: If the bottom of the lamp opens or if there is space within the lampshade, it could conceal small items.
>
> 6. **Under the rug**: Flat items could be hidden here, although it's a spot that could be easily disturbed.
>
> 7. **Inside plant pots**: If there are any removable false bottoms or if the plant is artificial, small items could be hidden in the soil.

I like that it mentioned the stove but warned that it could get hot there.

## Example: Taking AI for a walk

When I have things to figure out, such as the contents of this book, I like to take walks using AI as sounding board.

I start by saying "Always respond with the word OK unless I ask you for something". That way it will just listen and not interrupt. After I finishing dumping my thoughts, I ask for feedback and we have some discussion. Then I ask it to summarize in text afterwards.

Remember when I mentioned Prompt Design and Prompt Engineering? This is a good example of that.

- **Prompt Design** ("what can I do?") = coming up with the idea that AI could be useful as a sounding board when taking a walk.
- **Prompt Engineering** ("how do I do it?") = prompting it to only respond with "OK" initially, to allow me to finish dumping my thoughts before getting a response.

I recommend trying this. This is probably my favorite AI use case, I do it almost every day. All that walking is also good for my health ðŸ™‚.

Just a few days ago I was planning an inspirational talk for a group of CEOs. The event organizer showed me a slide with all the participants and companies. For my next walk, I sent a screenshot of that slide to ChatGPT and asked:

- "Tell me about these companies, what do they do, how large are they?"
- "I'm doing a Generative AI talk for this audience, what are the most important things I should cover?".
- "What are some things I should keep in mind when talking to a group like this?"

I got really useful input and ideas! Then I did the "just respond with OK" thing while I dumped a bunch of ideas for the talk, asked for feedback, and by the time I came home I had a really clear idea about what to say. I was able to prepare the talk really quickly, and the feedback from the participants was overwhelmingly positive.

Turns out Einstein isn't stuck in the basement after all, you can take him out for a walk!
