My experience is:

1. I get stuff done so much faster. Things that used to take days can be done in hours. Things that used to take hours can be done in minutes. I estimate that my average productivity is about 10x higher than before.
2. I learn faster. Whenever I get stuck or don't understand the generated code, I ask for explanation. This greatly accelerates my learning, it's like having a personal tutor with me at all times.

Despite this, I still it find it useful to work with other people, if nothing else for the social connection. The ideal scenario is mob programming with 2-3 people + AI.

However, I've realized that even though AI is brilliant at coding, I'm still needed as an architect. I'm the one writing the prompts, giving feedback, spotting hallucinations, and noticing when we're stuck in a can of worms. At the moment, AI works best together with a professional human coder. But for simple tasks, we're already getting to the point where a person with zero coding experience can actually build and implement code.

This is why I believe that developers who don't understand this technology might become unemployable - they'll simply be too slow. It's one of the reasons I decided to make this career shift. I want others to taste this level of productivity, to experience the feeling of going from idea to production in such a short time. That's a feeling I want to share.
