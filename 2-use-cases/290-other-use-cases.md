# More use cases

I mentioned Prompt Imagination in one of the early chapters.

> **Prompt Imagination**  
> Your ability to come up with ideas for how to use generative AI

Generative AI is a strange technology that takes some getting used to. Nothing can quite replace hands-on experience. You need to tinker with it, and the more you do, the more you'll come up with new and interesting ways to use it. The exact use cases will vary a lot depending on your background, lifestyle, interests, and profession.

In this chapter I'll give you some examples of what has been most useful to me. And then I'll add a brainstorm section with a bunch of more ideas. Hopefully you'll be inspired to try out some of these ideas yourself!

## Shopping list

I do this sometimes when heading out to my cabin or some other place, and I need to plan some grocery shopping.

> **Prompt (using voice)**
> I'm in the car, heading out to the cabin. I need to buy some groceries on the way.
> Here's a photo of the food I had in the cabin last time I was there,
> and here's another photo of the food I'm bringing from home.
> I'll dump some thoughts on you first, then I'll ask you to create a shopping list.

Then I spend the next few minutes thinking out loud, reading stuff into the chat. For example:

- We'll probably make Tacos on Wednesday, will need ingredients for that
- Ah, if we buy an extra big package of ground meat we can make paste bolognese the day after.
- Buy breakfast stuff: cereal, yoghurt, eggs.
- I wonder if we have honey. Hmmm. If not, need to buy that. And tea of course!
- We'll need at least 3 packages of milk.
- ...etc...

Sometimes I have people in the backseat yelling instructions too.

Then when we get to the store, I say:

> **Prompt (using voice)**
> I'm at the store now. Please give me a shopping list, organized by store section.
> And make sure I don't buy stuff that we already have in the cabin, or brought from home.

And then, tada, we get a beautiful list organized by store section, so we can get the shopping done really quickly.

## Personal tutor

My 12 year old son wanted to learn more about space. He wrote a prompt like this (with a bit of help from me):

> **Prompt**
> You are a really cool teacher.
> I am a 12 year old boy, I am very interested in space. I don't learn much about it in school, so I wnat you to be my tutor.
> I'm interested in the planets, the solar system, orbital physics, space travel, and stuff like that.
> Start by quzzing me to learn how much I know already.
> Grade my quiz and then help me understand the things that I got wrong.

He tried this, got a really interesting quiz from the AI teacher, learn a lot from the questions that he got wrong, and then had a lot of fun drilling down into various topics.

## The drunk funny code tutor

Here's another one from my 12 year old son. He wanted to learn how to build games using Unity (a game development platform).

The default personality of AI models tends to be pretty serious and professional. Kinda boring. So I showed him how to give his AI buddy a personality, using custom instructions.

He totally latched onto that, and configured his ChatGPT to take on the role of a drunk funny guy.

After that, he spent the whole day building a game while learning to program, assisted by his drunk-funny-guy AI buddy.

For example he would paste a screenshot from the gameand say "How do I make the ship move with the waves?". His AI tutor would respond like "Alright let's get that bad boy dancin' on the waves! Here's a script that'll make it bounce up and down like it's at a rock concert! <...code....>"

Even the code itself was written in a funny style, with variable names like "theDarnBoat", and functions like "makeTheBoatDance" and comments like "// woohoo, the boat's dancing!"

This made programming a lot more fun for him!

## Treasure hunt

A friend of mine told me about this one. He was a birthday party for his kid, and wanted to make a treasure hunt. But didn't have a lot of time or creativity at the moment. So he took some photos of the house, inside and outside, and prompted:

> **Prompt**  
> Design a treasure hunt for a children's birthday party. Here are photos from my house. Find good hiding spots and make a trail of clues that leads to a treasure.

The result was a really fun treasure hunt! AI didn't only save time, it also made the hunt more interesting than he could have done by himself.

## Even more use cases

You want more? OK, here's bunch.

I actually used AI to generate most of the list below, so you can use AI to generate 100 more if you like. Just write "Here's a bunch of Generative AI uses cases. Give me more!"
