# Interesting use cases

I mentioned Prompt Imagination in one of the early chapters.

> **Prompt Imagination**  
> Your ability to come up with ideas for how to use generative AI

Generative AI is a strange technology that takes some getting used to. Nothing can quite replace hands-on experience. You need to tinker with it, and the more you do, the more you'll come up with new and interesting ways to use it. The exact use cases will vary a lot depending on your background, lifestyle, interests, and profession.

In this chapter I'll give you some examples of what has been most useful to me. And then I'll add a brainstorm section with a bunch of more ideas. Hopefully you'll be inspired to try out some of these ideas yourself!





OK, let's have some fun! Here are some interesting ways to use generative AI. Some of these might seem a bit silly, but hey, that's part of the fun. And who knows, maybe it'll spark some ideas for how you can use AI in your own life or work.
## At home

- **Personal chef**: "I have eggs, spinach, and cheese in my fridge. What can I make for dinner?"
- **Fitness coach**: "Create a 30-minute workout routine that I can do at home with no equipment."
- **Bedtime storyteller**: "Tell me a bedtime story about a brave little girl and her magical unicorn friend."
- **Travel planner**: "Plan a 5-day itinerary for a family trip to Tokyo, including kid-friendly activities."
- **Gift idea generator**: "My mom loves gardening and mystery novels. What should I get her for her birthday?"
- **DIY helper**: "How can I build a simple birdhouse using materials I might have lying around the house?"
- **Language tutor**: "Teach me 10 common Spanish phrases for ordering food at a restaurant."
- **Joke writer**: "Write me a dad joke about programming."
- **Party planner**: "I'm throwing a Harry Potter themed birthday party for my 10-year-old. Give me some ideas for decorations, food, and games."
- **Gardening assistant**: "What vegetables are easy to grow in a small balcony garden, and when should I plant them?"

## At work

- **Meeting summarizer**: "Summarize this 1-hour meeting transcript into 5 key points and 3 action items."
- **Code debugger**: "Here's a Python function that's not working as expected. Can you help me find the bug?"
- **Email composer**: "Draft a polite email to a client explaining that we'll miss our deadline by two weeks."

- **Legal assistant**: "Summarize the key points of this 20-page contract in simple terms."
- **Brainstorming partner**: "Let's brainstorm ideas for improving employee engagement in a remote work environment."

## Creative projects

- **Song lyricist**: "Write lyrics for a country song about a heartbroken cowboy and his loyal dog."
- **Character creator**: "Create a detailed character profile for a wise, elderly elf in a fantasy novel."
- **Poetry generator**: "Write a haiku about the beauty of autumn leaves."
- **Art prompt creator**: "Give me 5 unique ideas for abstract paintings inspired by ocean waves."
- **Plot twister**: "I'm writing a murder mystery. Give me an unexpected plot twist that will surprise the readers."

Remember, these are just starting points. The real magic happens when you start combining and chaining these ideas together. For example, you could use AI to plan a party, then write invitations, then create a shopping list, then come up with game ideas, and so on.

The key is to let your imagination run wild. If you can think it, there's probably a way to use AI to help you do it. And if you're not sure how to start, just ask the AI: "How can you help me with X?" You might be surprised by the creative suggestions it comes up with!
