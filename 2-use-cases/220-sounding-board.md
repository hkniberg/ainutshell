# Use case: Sounding board

In the [Multimodal Models](../1-main/080-multimodal-models.md) chapter I mentioned "Taking AI for a walk".

I start by saying "Always respond with the word OK unless I ask you for something". That way it will just listen and not interrupt. After I finishing dumping my thoughts, I ask for feedback and we have some discussion. Then I ask it to summarize in text afterwards.

I'm repeating that here because this is one of my favorite use cases. I do this almost every day. Nice health benefit too, with all that walking! This book alone has gotten me at least 100,000 steps ðŸ™‚.
