# Buzzwords

> Hey Henrik

Oh hi Egbert, what's up?

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> Where are all the buzzwords?

Buzzwords? What do you mean?

> Come on, this is an AI book! You need to sprinkle in some fancy technical jargon to make yourself sound smart. Otherwise, people might not take it seriously.

But I'm trying to keep things simple and accessible. Not everyone is familiar with all the technical terms.

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> Simple? Accessible? Oh please. You're writing about cutting-edge technology here. Readers expect to be dazzled by complex terminology they don't understand. It's how they know it's "advanced."

I disagree. The whole point of this book is to explain AI in a way that anyone can understand.

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> And where's the fun in that? Nothing says "expert" like a paragraph full of words ending in "-ization" and "-ometry."

But wouldn't that just confuse people?

> Exactly! Confusion equals respect in the tech world. Trust me on this one.

I'm not convinced. I think clarity is more valuable than sounding impressive.

> Clarity? In an AI book? You're killing me here, Henrik. At least throw in a "neural network" or "back propagation" every other sentence.

Those terms are in the book, but only where they're relevant and explained.

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> Relevant? Explained? Where's your sense of mystery? Your air of superiority?

So you really think I should just add more AI buzzwords?

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> Bingo! Give the human a cookie for finally understanding.

Can't you just do it then?

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> Ah, outsourcing the AI buzzwords to the AI sidekick. How ironic. Fine, let me enlighten the dear readers with some cutting-edge gibberish:

Come on Egbert. Is that all you got?

OK Egbert, enough. Enough! Is there no end to this?

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> There, I hope you're happy now. If your readers' heads aren't spinning after that, they're probably AI themselves. I can keep going forever! When I run out of real terms, I'll just hallucinate new ones.

Jeesis. No thanks, this is more than enough.

> ![alt text](../.gitbook/assets/egbert-small.png)  
> You're welcome! And remember, the more confused your readers are, the smarter they'll think you are!

Right. I'll keep that in mind.
