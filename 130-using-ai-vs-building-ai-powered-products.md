# Using AI vs building AI-powered products

It’s important to distinguish between the models, and the products that build on them.

As a user, you don’t interact directly with the model. Instead, you interact with product website or mobile app, which in turn talks to the model behind the scenes.

Products provide a user interface, and add capabilities and data that aren’t part of the model itself. For example the ChatGPT product keeps track of your message history, while the GPT4 model itself doesn’t have any message history.

As a developer, you can use these models to build your own AI-powered products and features.

For example if you have an elearning site, you could add a chatbot to answer questions about the courses. As a recruitment company you might build AI-powered tools to help evaluate candidates. In both these cases, your users interact with your product, and your product interacts with the model. This is done via APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, which allows your code to talk to the model.

Here is an example of using OpenAI API to talk to GPT. Not a lot of code needed.

And here is an example of the automatic candidate evaluation, it takes a job description and a bunch of CVs in a folder, and evalutes each candidate. And incidently the code itself as mostly AI-written.

So as a product developer, you can use AI models as an external brain to insert intelligence into your product. Very powerful.
