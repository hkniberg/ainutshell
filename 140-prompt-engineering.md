# Prompt engineering

In order to use Generative AI effectively, you need to get good at Prompt Engineering, or Prompt Design as I prefer to call it.

This skill is needed both as a user and as a product developer. In both cases you need to be able to craft effective prompts that produce useful results from an AI model.

Here’s an example. Let’s say I want help planning a workshop.

This prompt is unlikely to give useful results. No matter how smart the AI is, if it doesn’t know the context of my workshop, it can only give vague, high level recommendations.

This second prompt is better. Now I provided a context. This is normally done iteratively. Write a prompt, look at the result, add a followup prompt to provide more information, or edit the original prompt. Rinse and repeat until you get a good result.

In this third approach I ask it to interview me. So instead of me providing a bunch of context upfront, I’m basically saying “what do you need to know in order to help me”. Then it will propose a workshop agenda after.

I often combine these two. I provide a bit of context, and tell it to ask me if it needs any more info.

Overall, the better you get at Prompt Engineering, the faster and better results you will get from AI. There are plenty of courses, books, videos, and articles to help you learn this, but the most important thing is to practice, and learn by doing.

A nice side effect is that you will become better at communicating in general, since Prompt Engineering is really all about clarity and effective communication.
