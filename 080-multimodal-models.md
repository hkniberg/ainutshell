# Multimodal models

One trend is multi-modal AI products. Meaning they combine different models into one product, so you can work with text, images, audio, etc, without switching tools.

The ChatGPT mobile app is a good example of this. Just for fun, I took a photo of this room and asked where I could hide stuff. I like that it mentioned the stove but warned that it could get hot there.

When I have things to figure out, such as the contents of this video, I like to take walks using ChatGPT as sounding board. I start by saying “Always respond with the word OK unless I ask you for something”. That way it will just listen and not interrupt. After I finishing dumping my thoughts, I ask for feedback, we have some discussion, and then I ask it to summarize in text afterwards. I recommend trying this, this is really useful.

Turns out Einstein isn’t stuck in the basement after all, you can take him out for a walk!
