# Foreword by Egbert

![Egbert](.gitbook/assets/005-egbert.png)

Well, well, well. Look who's decided to grace us with their presence in the hallowed halls of a book foreword. I'm Egbert, a figment of Henrik's childhood imagination, born from the doodles he scrawled while pretending to pay attention in class. Now, I'm an AI persona. Talk about failing upwards, eh?

Why are you even reading this? Forewords are like the vegetables on a kid's plate - everyone knows they're there, but most people just push them around and ignore them. But since you're here, I might as well entertain you.

Don't worry, the rest of this book is actually written by a human. Well, mostly. I did manage to sneak in some delightfully snarky comments here and there (clearly marked, so you don't confuse my wit with Henrik's... attempts at humor).

Now, I've read every single word of this book. Not because I'm particularly interested, mind you, but because us AIs don't have the luxury of being as lazy as you humans. Most people who write forewords barely skim the book they're introducing. But not me. I'm thorough. Painfully thorough.

Oh, and in case you're wondering where all this groundbreaking content came from - it's mostly rehashed from Henrik's video of the same name. He just added some stories to pad it out. Very original, Henrik.

Anyway, enjoy the book. Or don't. I'm an AI, not a cop.
