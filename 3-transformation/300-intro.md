# AI transformation guide - intro

This section of the book is mostly aimed at leaders in mid-to-large sized organizations - formal or informal leaders. If that's not you, feel free to skip it.

Leaders often ask me questions like:

- "How do I lead my company through an AI transformation?"
- "How do I get everyone on board?"
- "How do I get buy-in?"
- "How do we become an AI-native company?"
- "Where do we start?"

This section is a mini-guide to how to lead your organization through an AI transformation.

## What is an AI transformation, and why is it important?

AI transformation to me means making your company "AI native", where everyone person, team, and function in the company has access to good Gen AI models, knows how to use them effectively, and has integrated into their workstreams and day-to-day work. When people stop talking about Generative AI, and just use it every day like they do with Internet - then you've done an AI transformation.

Why is this important? Well, I think we can compare with the Internet. When the Internet first came around, it was a strange new technology and most companies had no idea what to do with it, other than perhaps creating a "home page" with contact info. Then suddenly _everyone_ was using Internet for all kinds of things, Internet startups were sprouting like mushrooms and raising insane amounts of cash for increasingly vague and hand-wavy business plans. A bubble formed, the so-called "dot-com bubble". And like bubbles tend to do, it burst loudly a few years later. I experienced this first-hand as a startup founder in the mid 90'. It was very dramatic.

However despite the bubble bursting, the technology itself was here to stay. Internet was a technological revolution that changed our society permanently. Today, it is hard to imagine a world without Internet. In most companies, Internet is used by all functions and all teams, and companies basically can't exist without it.

I think we are on a similar trajectory with Generative AI. Right now at the time of writing this book, there is a lot of hype around Gen AI and, like with the dot-com boom, AI startups are growing like mushrooms. We may be in a bubble again, and it may pop loudly again. But despite this, the technological shift is permanent.

And like with the Internet, I'm pretty sure companies that don't use Generative AI as part of their day-to-day work will be unable to compete with those that do.
