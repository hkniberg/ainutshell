# Assign an AI Champion

AI-transforming a mid-to-large sized organization is a big task. It will require focus and persistence. So I recommend assigning someone to this full-time. It can be an existing role that you reshape for this, or an entirely new role. It can be an existing employee, or a new hire.

Call the role what you like - AI champion, Head of AI, CAIO, Chief AI whisperer, or whatever makes sense. I'll use the term AI champion in this book.

The AI champion should be:

- **Curious**. The Gen AI field is moving fast, and the AI champion should be eager to learn and keep up with the latest trends. You definitely don't want a person who thinks they already know everything.
- **Inspiring**. The AI champion should be able to get others excited about AI and help them understand its potential. Curiousity is most useful when it is contagious!
- **Patient and persistent**. An AI transformation is a marathon, not a sprint. The champion needs to overcome bureaucratic hurdles, organizational resistance and cultural inertia. They can't give up at the first setback.
- **Pragmatic and grounded**. They should encourage and support teams to look for practical solutions to real problems. People need to be allowed to play around with the technology to learn, but at the end of the day AI is a tool and people should look for ways to apply it to their work.
- **Not a control freak**. The AI champion should not be an information bottleneck, or a person who tries to control all AI initiatives. They should set clear policies and guidelines, but not micromanage. They should be fine with not knowing what everyone is doing with AI.

So what does the AI champion do? Well, that's what the rest of this book section is about.
